# NASA-Kepler-space-telescope

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, machine learning models will be created to identify their capabilities of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

In this assignment, we will need to:

1. Preprocess the raw data
2. Tune the models
3. Compare two or more models

There were three models utilized in this assignment to identify the best model for this this assigned dataset. The three models were the Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and the Random Forest. After applying these models, the best model for this dataset was the Support Vector Machine. The Support Vector Machine scored 85% for the Training Data and the Testing Data Score was 83%. Using the Random Forest's training data was 100% so that informed the data scientist that more data would be required for this model. With the Support Vector Machine model, the predictions were accurate about 87% of the time. This shows the Support Vector Machine model being the best fit for the dataset.
